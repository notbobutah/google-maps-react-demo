    Purpose: render a map image with a movable marker that
     indicates location of weather data displayed in the 
     floating info box.

     This app uses react-scripts to run:
        run npm install and then npm start, a browser should open automatically.




This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
